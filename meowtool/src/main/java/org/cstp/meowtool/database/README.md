# ATTENTION
When you edit contents here, you need to update contents in the sql/init.sql as well. Or the database structure will corrupte. I know a migration is a better choice but i have no time to learn such a framework for java, since typically i only coding in C#.

However, i hope somebody from my group will read this rather than someone who just visit in this project for no purpose.
